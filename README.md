# SAFE-Sustainability-Project
This repository contains the work conducted by Michelle Weng, Nayeon Choi, and Hengnan Ma from the Cooper Union Advancement of Science and Art in assessing the overall sustainability of L'Oreal in a Sustainability/Pollution Prevention course
## Project Overview
In the competitive and growing cosmetics industry, sustainability is increasingly important for both consumers and businesses. In 2022, the global cosmetics market was valued at $430 billion and is expected to reach $580 billion by 2027[1]. Despite economic challenges, the beauty market, including skincare, fragrance, makeup, and haircare, continues to expand.

As competition intensifies, brands have to adapt to the evolving landscape. For instance, e-commerce now accounts for over 20% of beauty sales and is expected to grow 12% annually between 2022-2027, reducing the market share of physical stores[1].

This rapid growth has led to high resource consumption, increased waste, and environmental concerns. Consumers and activists push for sustainable practices, urging companies to adopt eco-friendly changes and reduce their carbon footprint.

L'Oréal, a leading multinational beauty company established in 1909, is known for its diverse, high-quality product line. In 2022, L'Oréal generated €29.9 billion ($32 billion) in sales across 150 countries with 88,000 employees[2]. This report outlines the rationale for using the SAFE model to support L'Oréal’s sustainability efforts.
